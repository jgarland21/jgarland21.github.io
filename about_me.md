<!-- About -->

<p><span class="image right"><img src="{% link assets/images/profile_full.JPG %}" alt="" /></span>I am an astrophysics student at Haverford College, aspiring science communicator, jewelry maker, and self-taught computer programmer from New York City.
<br><br>
At Haverford, I have worked with professors Karen Masters and Daniel Grin on studying observational techniques for testing axion dark matter. As Co-Head of Haverford's Strawbridge Observatory public observing nights, I have been able to explore my interests in science education, communication, and outreach.
<br><br>
I began pursuing my ambitions in astrophysics under Dr. Michael Shara and Dr. Nathan Leigh in the department of astrophysics research at the Museum of Natural History, co-authoring two papers published in 2017.
<br><br>
Outside of academia, I have a passion for jewelry making. For ten years, I studied the craft under the guidance of Amy Haskins. A selection of my work can be found via my portfolio page. Over two summers, I had the pleasure of co-teaching metalworking and jewelry making classes for young students at the 92nd Street Y.
<br><br>
In my free time I enjoy astrophotography, writing, and practicing Arabic.
