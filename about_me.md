<!-- About -->

<p><span class="image right"><img src="{% link assets/images/profile_full.png %}" alt="" /></span>I am a postbac astrophysicist and aspiring science communicator from New York City.</p>

<p>I currently work with Dr. Michael Shara at the American Museum of Natural History, using data from the <a href="https://condorarraytelescope.org/">Condor Array Telescope</a> to study the erruption behavior of classical novae. I also focus on identifying narrowband transients in this data to assess the population of extragalactic cataclysmic variables.</p>

<p>I graduated from Haverford College in 2022 with a B.S. in physics and astronomy, where I worked with professor Karen Masters to produce my senior thesis on observationally testing how tidal interactions between galaxies affect their evolution. I also worked with professors Karen Masters and Daniel Grin on studying observational techniques for testing axion dark matter. As Co-Head of Haverford's Strawbridge Observatory public observing nights, I explored my interests in science education, communication, and outreach.</p>

<p>Outside of academia, I enjoy astrophotography, playing guitar, and making jewelry (a selection of my work can be found <a href="https://imgur.com/a/B5sLG">here</a>).</p>

<p>You can find my CV <a href="{% link assets/CV/CV.pdf %}" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>If you would like to reach me, send me an <a href="mailto:james@jamesgarland.net?">email</a> and I'll get back to you as soon as possible.</p>
